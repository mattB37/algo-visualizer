# Very basic sorting and graph search algorithm visualizer

possible future update ideas: use react-force-graph or d3.js instead of react-flow for the rendering of the graph visualizer (would be really cool to see a 3d visualization)\
add more unique sorting algorithms\
add a visualization of a stack / queue along with the graph visualization so you can see what nodes are in the stack or queue as the traversal progresses.\
